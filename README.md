I integrate python and sql to analyze and query data of Malaysia and other country in the region East Asia/South East Asia from the https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/. Later I visualize the data of Asean countries using the Microsoft Power BI. 
Some interesting data that can be seen is Malaysia has 92,000 residents who living with HIV make it the 47th country with most resident with HIV out of 143 countries.
Percentage wise there are 0.27 percent from total population of Malaysia who are infected with the HIV.  It is crucial to end the negative stigma towards people living with HIV who has such a high number in Malaysia because with modern medicine and treatment the hiv virus can be suppressed make it undetectable and untransmittable.

The total population of Asean countries is 688 million with 2 million people living with hiv.
